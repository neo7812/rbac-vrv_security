Role Based Access Control

This is a Role Based Access Control application using Nodejs, Express, Passport Js, etc.

For authentication we have only Email & Password option but other authentication options using OAuth/OAuth2.0 like Google, Facebook, Apple, GitHub, etc, can be easily incorporated.

The application is based on the **MVC pattern** i.e. Model View Controller.

**Mongoose** is used as an ORM for MongoDB for storing Users in Database.

**Passport JS** is used for local(email, password) authentication.
